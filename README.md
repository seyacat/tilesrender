Tiles Render

HOW TO USE

Once you installed the addon file into your Blender you're ready to go.

This addon functions inside a Dropbox enviroment. So the first thing you should do, is to save your .blend into a Dropbox file and share it with the other partners you want to share the render process with.

Everyone involved in the Render Sharing Process should open the File from that folder and the file owner will leave the Active Tilerender Box empty while the rest of the partners will tick that box.

 

The interface it's simple. Just press Render and the Render Sharing Process will start.

A new file will be created in the shared Dropbox file called "TilesRender" where all the tiles from every partner will be placed.

Once all the tiles are rendered, you must press Refresh Image and the tiles will be mixed on the UV map viewer.

When the render is calculating, the box Working will be ticked.
If you want to clean the file TilesRender where all the tiles were created, you just press Remove Cache.

It functions with individual and stereo images, you should use PNG/RGBA.
Let us know if you have troubles with it.
Enjoy!
